## Summary
The event weather app provides a weather forecast for a given event. The user searches for the event they plan to
attend and then chooses search results for which weather forecasts are displayed. An example of a use case
for the app is to help users decide what kind of clothing to wear to their event. A user could even decide not to attend an event if the weather is very bad. If the event is more than a week away, the user is prompted to upgrade to a paid subscription. 

The Ticketmaster API is used to retrieve event information and the Open Weather API is used for the weather forecasts.
